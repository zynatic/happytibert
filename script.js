    "First off, Iâ€™m just so happy that I get to be part of your life. Like, seriously, JUST WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE YOU? 16 years of you being in this world, and Iâ€™m beyond grateful that I get to be the one who gets to be called yours. When I think about the day we first met, I canâ€™t help but laugh at how it all started during our silly gacha phase. Who wouldâ€™ve thought that something so random would lead to something this special?",

    "Youâ€™re not just my girlfriend; Youâ€™re my best friend, my confidante, my muse, and honestly, so much more. I can talk to you about anything and everything, and you just get me, yk? Like, I can be my complete, unfiltered self around you, and you accept me for who i am, flaws and allat ig. That means more to me than I can put into words. <br><br>" +
   "And can I just take a moment to appreciate how absolutely stunning you are? Youâ€™ve been gorgeous since day oneâ€”those baby pics donâ€™t lie, chatðŸ˜‚! but itâ€™s not just about how you look, like, letâ€™s be real, youâ€™re drop-dead beautiful. Itâ€™s also about who you are as a person. Youâ€™ve got this warmth, this light that just radiates from you (no cap it's reaching for me here). You make everyone around you better, including me. Iâ€™m so proud of the person youâ€™ve become and excited for the person youâ€™re still becoming. The futureâ€™s looking amazing with you in it.",
    "I love every single moment we share. even when weâ€™re apart, youâ€™re always on my mind. I miss you like crazy when youâ€™re not here, and itâ€™s like thereâ€™s this empty space in my life that only you can fill. When youâ€™re around, everything feels right. Youâ€™re the person i want by my side, no matter what life throws our way. In these months, youâ€™ve already seen me at my best and my worst, and you still choose to be with me, and thatâ€™s something i donâ€™t take for granted. <br><br>" +
    "I know iâ€™ve been busy lately, and I havenâ€™t been able to give you everything I want to, but trust me, iâ€™m working on it. Iâ€™ve got so many plans for us, for you, and Iâ€™m gonna make sure those plans turn into reality. You deserve the world, and iâ€™m determined to give you as much of it as i can.",
    "I love you so much, more than words can ever really express. Youâ€™ve brought so much joy, love, and light into my life, and iâ€™m just so incredibly grateful for you. So hereâ€™s to you, my loveâ€”on your special day and every day after. Happy Birthday, and hereâ€™s to all the amazing things weâ€™re gonna do together in the future. I love you, and I hope you have a wonderful day.",
